# Habit Tracking App 

It's okay to build things that exist. I'll be building this to myself, and then releasing it on the play store for people who'd like to use it. 
Just a way to track habits, motivate me for my habits, give cues which will help me and a 'yipeee' each time I finish a habit for the day. 
Other than this, I just want this app to be the way for me to get out of my coding slump. Last time I coded was when ChatGPT just entered the scene.

v0.0.1 - 9 october 2025
- completed this in 1.5 days, this version doesn't have much. 
- Currently it's just a way for me to log my intermittent fasts, if they were for 12, 14 or 16 hours, and on what dates. 

I can also log it for previous days using a feature called bulk update. 
This is just a start, I would like to bring in habits - some pre-set and some random ones which can be added by users. 
I would also like to bring nudges which help in habit formation learned through the books i've read. 
Other than this, I would also love to add an aspect of community. 

coding aspect: 
right now i've created it using a backend service, but the plan is to change it to a complete backend (by beta version)

notes on ai: you'll be debugging the code of AI, i spent more than a day debugging everything that AI wrote. It's irritating, but I will keep using it.
