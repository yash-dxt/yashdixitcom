## I read my first fiction book

my goodreads just btw: https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94783553-yash-dixit

i am trying to develop a habit of reading, and i have been reading something or another - for about a month now. i started in october. 

my habit’s goal was just to read one page of the book. 

i had never read fiction in my life, i thought it was a waste of time. so after wasting my time with self help books, i came along and read my first fiction book. 

i read harry potter and the philosopher’s stone. 

at the start of the book, there was some kinda guilt on what i was reading, but after about a 100 pages, and a delay of a month, i started to read again, and read around 160-170 pages in two days. 

it was so much fun, i was smiling while reading! 

i fell in love with hagrid - he is truly my favourite - a sweet heart. 

it felt like i was living in another world, it’s such an amazing thing us humans can do this. we can imagine stuff, we can imagine by reading, and i think we live a little too much in the real world - we should take out time, and escape reality sometimes! 

i am pretty sure that i’ll be reading more and more fiction now :) 

good day!
