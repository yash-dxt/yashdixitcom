<p>my goodreads just btw: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94783553-yash-dixit">https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/94783553-yash-dixit</a></p>
<p>i am trying to develop a habit of reading, and i have been reading something or another - for about a month now. i started in october.</p>
<p>my habit’s goal was just to read one page of the book.</p>
<p>i had never read fiction in my life, i thought it was a waste of time. so after wasting my time with self help books, i came along and read my first fiction book.</p>
<p>i read harry potter and the philosopher’s stone.</p>
<p>at the start of the book, there was some kinda guilt on what i was reading, but after about a 100 pages, and a delay of a month, i started to read again, and read around 160-170 pages in two days.</p>
<p>it was so much fun, i was smiling while reading!</p>
<p>i fell in love with hagrid - he is truly my favourite - a sweet heart.</p>
<p>it felt like i was living in another world, it’s such an amazing thing us humans can do this. we can imagine stuff, we can imagine by reading, and i think we live a little too much in the real world - we should take out time, and escape reality sometimes!</p>
<p>i am pretty sure that i’ll be reading more and more fiction now :)</p>
<p>good day!
