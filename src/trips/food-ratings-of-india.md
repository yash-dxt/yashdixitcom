| **Jaipur**   | very mid kachoris - both hing kachoris & onion kachoris.                                                        | 5/10       |
| **Kota**     | great dal kachoris, but I like Delhi ones slightly more because they get served with sabji rather than chutney. | 7.5/10     |

| **Aligarh**  | Flat Kachoris with Spicy Aloo Sabji & Raita, got to be one of my favourite.                                     | **9/10**   |
